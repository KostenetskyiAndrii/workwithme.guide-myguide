## Values

- I values **honesty, directness, and desire to learn**. 
- I think healthy pragmatism should be always considered an important metric.

## Personality

- I am a part of a team. 
- I absorb lots of information and try to keep my hand on the pulse of the latest trends 
- I do not suffer silently. I **express my needs ** and expect others to do
    the same.
- I am always trying to be positive. 
- I am trying to keep a work-life balance

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

- Feedback is my air. Without the proper feedback - I have the impression that I am moving in darkness 
- Judgement does not help anybody. Let's stay focused on "we are not blaming anybody - we are searching the possibility how to avoid this kind of situation in future"

## Work Patterns

- I am trying to work from 9 am till 18pm - as I have a lot of personal tracks. 
- I prefer to stay focused on 1 task in a moment of time for the best productivity.  

## Communication Preferences

- Slack me first. I’ll do what I can to respond upon availability.
- I would like to stay focused on the topic of the meeting rather than speak about everything at the moment of time...
This does not mean that I don't like a good joke or to speak about moto or cars or IT :) It's about the focus and balance

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side


### Warning Signs

- If I say that I am "uncomfortable" then I am.

### How to help

- Please, be always direct. If I am asking for help - it means I got two types of situations: a lack of time, or a lack of experience. 

## Me Being Me

- In general, I open-minded and down-earth person which really appreciates direct messages and has a natural desire to help. 


## Pet Peeves

- Meetings without outcomes / decisions.
- I do not like when people are negative about other engineers or don't know the full context. Everybody works the best they can.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

- Short term: be fully operational and able to handle all kind of tasks within the company. Get some certifications. 
- Long term: My desire is to become an architect - it means to have the deep understanding of "how it works" 

## Areas for Development

- life is a learning - there is no end to become a "good engineer"
